        <p>
            Hello world!<br>
            This <i>"little"</i> project of mine required much more time and effort than what I had first anticipated.<br>
            The whole Luv token idea was at first a fun little exercise to learn more about smart contracts and to (hopefully) make some money.<br>
            The thing is that to complete this I ended up learning HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, Solidity (and the OpenZeppelin library) as well as using the Embark and Foundation frameworks!..<br>
            That was quite a lot to learn!<br>
            And yes I had to learn all this because I'm no programmer. I'm just a guy who finished high school last year.<br>
            <i>(I'm going to study Mathematics by the way)</i><br>
            <br>
            In order to go through all those hardships and finish this big project on my own, my goals had to change.<br>
            This is no longer just a fun little project. This is my art.<br>
            This is my vivid red mark in a mundane and devoid of <b>true</b> love world.<br>  
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="intro"><b>Introduction</b></h2>
        <p>
            Love is the most important and powerful emotion. <i>(The one that always defeats the bad witch)</i><br>
            You may even say that love is the strongest force in the whole universe.<br>
            Considering that, it is a shame that love has been reduced to stuff.<br>
            It truly is devastating that love is being related with money; and in general material possessions.. <br>
            Following that logic, actually turning love into a token and selling it would be the worst.<br>
            However, the idea is an ideal irony which is so much needed to wake up people.<br>
            <b>Love can't be bought.</b><br>
            Then again... it can.  
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="problem"><b>Error 404. Love not found.</b></h2>
        <p>
            People forgot how to truly love and instead express their love with money.<br>
            That is flawed since love is not a thing; love is an emotion, it's a bond.<br>
            The confusion of money with true love leads to multiple fatal errors.<br>
            First and foremost, due to that, many are led to believe that love is <b>non-existent</b>...<br>
            Moreover, those who are still "believers" are in constant agony since nobody can guarantee that you will keep your love.<br>
            Love is not secure nor can you know exactly how much you are loved.<br>
            Last but not least, it is an undoubtable fact that<br>
            <i>most times people give more for the amount of love that they receive in exchange...</i>  
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="solution"><b>Introducing Luv; love tokenized.</b></h2>
        <p>
            Luv is a mintable ERC20 token.<br>
            The only purpose of Luv is to serve as the token of love.<br>
            By naming it Luv we differentiate it from true Love. "Luv is the kind of love you can buy, sell or trade..".<br>
            That sets Luv apart from the emotion and adds some benefits since it's a token in the Ethereum blockchain.<br>
            Luv is secured in the immutable blockchain. Nobody can steal your Luv!<br>
            It also removes uncertainty of the amount of Luv you possess since it's countable with a precision of 18 decimal places.<br>
            At any time Luv can be obtained directly via the crowdsale's contract or through the site.<br>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 id="details"><b>Crowdsale details:</b></h2>
        <p>
            The crowdsale begins at August 1st, 2019 12:00 AM GMT.<br>
            It ends at January 1st, 2030 12:00 AM GMT.<br>
            Luv's initial total supply is 0 LUV. Every time you purchase
            Luv with your ethereum<br>
            Luv is created, sent to your wallet and the total supply increases.<br>
            At first the rate is 1 million LUV/ETH meaning that you get 1 million LUV for 1 ETH.<br>
            The rate decreases by 10 for every million Luv purchased, meaning that when the total supply is 1 million LUV
            the rate is 999990 LUV/ETH.<br> Therefore, Luv's price increases as the total supply increases.<br>
            There is no hard cap ,however, at 100 Billion LUV the rate will be 0 LUV/ETH so that could be considered the "hard cap" even though there is no limit on the amount of Luv you can buy in one transaction.<br>
            As a result theoritically more than 100 Billion LUV could be minted in total despite the fact that it's practically impossible to buy such a great amount of Luv -at once- to go beyond the 100 Billion LUV "hard cap" (or to buy enough Luv at all, once the rate is really low).<br>

        <h2 id="funds"><b>Ethereum collected</b></h2>
        <p>
          All ethereum collected will be the fuel of my life to help me achieve my goals.<br>
          If I receive a lot of ethereum then I will be able to sustain myself while studying in the university and
          fund my next projects; which will be much greater.

    <h2 id="faqs"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>
      <li>
          <h2>What is Luv?</h2>
          <p>
          It's an ERC20 token living in the Ethereum blockchain.<br>
          Luv is love turned into a coin!
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h2>What can I do with Luv?</h2>
          <p>Everything you can do with Love! You can give it, receive it and more!<br>
          Luv can be sold and be bought! Directly and straightforward.<br>
          It can also be traded for all sorts of useless stuff (just like any other ERC20 token).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h2>How much Luv is there?</h2>
          <p>At first none! Each time you buy Luv from here, new Luv will be minted and the supply will increase.<br>
          To keep things balanced the price will also increase.<br> At some point Luv will be too expensive to buy so there is an upper limit of about 80 Billion Luv that I estimate will be minted at best.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h2>How does Luv's price change?</h2>
          <p>Luv's price depends on Ethereum price and on the currect supply of Luv tokens.<br>
          At first the rate was 1 million LUV per 1 ETH (1000000 LUV/ETH).<br>
          The initial rate decreases by 10 LUV/ETH for every million Luv minted.<br>
          Therefore the price which is 1/rate increases.</p>
